## Problems

[x] Cursor seems to go from first to last, unlike in go version.
[x] Separate errors for each operation looks like an overkill, they overlap a lot
  [x] There are plenty of unwraps to be removed
[ ] Writing newlines should be platform independent
[x] Image format is not detected
[ ] Decode uses '\t' instead of constant
[ ] Delete commands are not implemented yet
[x] Trim length could be much simpler
