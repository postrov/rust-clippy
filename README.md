## Problems

[x] Cursor seems to go from first to last, unlike in go version.
[ ] Separate errors for each operation looks like an overkill, they overlap a lot
  [ ] There are plenty of unwraps to be removed
[ ] Writing newlines should be platform independent
[x] Image format is not detected
[ ] Decode uses '\t' instead of constant
[ ] Delete commands are not implemented yet
